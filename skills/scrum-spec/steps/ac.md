# ac · Story, rules and acceptance criteria

`<command> ac <work>` plus a card, a bug report, or a PDF or image path · for Refinement · readers do not read the code

Goal: the PO approves a draft instead of writing one, and what two devs could build differently is asked before Planning.

## Before drafting

1. Create `<docs_root>/<work>/spec.md` if missing (a story from `split` already has its Story)
2. Grep other specs in `<docs_root>` for the same screen or rule; cite them in Source and reuse their rule wording
3. Find what already exists in the code: screens, routes, APIs, permission checks. A found fact is a source, not a question

## Rules

- Story and Rules come from the input; a missing part (often "so that") is written "Proposal: …"
- One AC row = one behavior a person can see or check. AC = main flow · EC = edge cases (empty, too long, no permission, failure, double submit)
- Story, Rules and AC use words seen on screen, no paths, fields or endpoints; code evidence goes in Source
- Every button, field and state (empty, error, no permission) on input screens is in an AC/EC, Out of scope, or a question
- **Bug:** the Story section has **Now**, **Expected** and **Repro** instead of the user story. AC = the correct behavior · EC = what must not change
- A new or changed API: a question for its owner in `roles` (else Dev), Blocks `tasks`, with a one-line proposed contract
- Keep existing AC and add only what is missing; a cut AC keeps its number in Out of scope ("was EC4")
- **Review before asking:** read the draft as a dev and as the tester; fix or ask about the places two people would read differently (data rules, permissions, states, errors, vague words like "fast" or "own")

## Template

```markdown
## Story

- **Ticket:** (ticket ID or –)
- **Story:** As a … I want … so that …
- **In scope:**
  - (one topic per line)
- **Out of scope:**
  - (one topic per line)
- **Source:** (input page or frame, related specs, code paths found)

## Rules

- **(group, e.g. Permissions)**
  - (one rule per line)

## Acceptance Criteria

**approve:** ❌ waiting for PO

| # | Given | When | Then |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC1 | | | |
| EC1 | | | |

## Questions

| # | Question | Ask | Blocks | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | (one question; "Proposal: …" if there is one) | (a role) | AC / tasks / later | |

## Decisions

- (none yet)
```

- Blocks: `AC` = needed to approve · `tasks` = needed to break down the work · `later` = changes nothing structural
- The PO approves in chat, or by editing the line to `**approve:** ✅ <name> · <YYYY-MM-DD>`

## After drafting

- Too big (over 4 rule groups): propose a split and ask
- Next: `tasks` once no question blocks `AC`
